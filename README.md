# About Me
My name is Tricia Brooker. I am currently a student at the Stack Education Web Development Bootcamp.
I have previously worked in the convenience store industry as a store manager. Prior to that, I was a New York State EMT-B, until a car accident that caused lasting damage to my leg.
## For Fun
For fun, I enjoy spending time in Florida visiting family, reading, and listening to music.
